# Summary

Going to provide seniors from Del Norte a website that displays who is still in/out in Senior Assassins + other cool features. The main goal is to have one page with every player listed with their corresponding photo and either a red X on them (Out) or a green checkmark (Still in). It will provide a higher lever of conveniency for the players
