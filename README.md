# Summary

Going to provide seniors from Del Norte a website that displays who is still in/out in Senior Assassins + other cool features. The main goal is to have one page with every player listed with their corresponding photo and either a red X on them (Out) or a green checkmark (Still in). It will provide a higher lever of conveniency for the players

**Ishan Kapoor Total Grade: /10**

Ishan Kapoor Team Grade: 4/5 - I cannot tell if he has completed his tasks or not. I assigned him the minilab which he put a check on his ticket for but I do not see a link to the code nor do I see anything in his commits regarding the minilab. However, he still made some changes but it was only to our readme.
